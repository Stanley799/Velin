## Development
This project uses Vite for lightning-fast development and HMR. ESLint is set up for code quality.

### Useful Vite/React Template Info
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#### React Compiler
The React Compiler is not enabled by default. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

#### Expanding the ESLint configuration
For production, consider using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules. See the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).
